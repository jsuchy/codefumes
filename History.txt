=== 0.4.1 / 2011-May-21

* Added support for Ruby 1.9.2 [thanks Jim Suchy! (@jsuchy)]

=== 0.4.0 / 2010-Oct-10

NEW FEATURES:
* Added --exec flag to 'fumes build' command to simplify incorporating
  into an existing build server setup
  * Expects your build command an argument to --exec and wraps that
    command with the 'start' and (appropriate) 'finished' commands for
    the specified build (assumes your build command uses an exit status
    of '0' as a successful build, and anything else as a failure)
    Example:
      $ fumes build --exec="bundle install && rake db:migrate && rake spec" build-name
      # Issues 'fumes build --start build-name'
      # Issues "bundle install && rake db:migrate && rake spec"

      # ...if the command exited with a status of '0'
      # Issues 'fumes build --finished="successful" build-name'

      # ...if the command exited with a non-zero status
      # Issues 'fumes build --finished="failed" build-name'

BUG FIXES/UPDATES:
* Fixed error when no build name was specified with the '--start',
  '--finished', or '--exec' options to 'fumes build'
* Corrected output from "fumes help build" to be in sync with expected usage
* Updated links in README

=== 0.3.0 / 2010-09-12

NEW FEATURES:
* Added Commit#builds, which returns all associated builds of a commit
* Implemented initial form of 'fumes build' command
  * Allows you to manage the state of builds associated with a project
    [thanks Roy Kolak]
    Examples:
      # starts a build named 'specs' with the latest commit on the
      # CodeFumes project (sets state to 'running' & start time to 'now')
      fumes build --start specs

      # Set the resulting build status of 'specs' build (end time is set to 'now')
      fumes build --finished=successful specs
      fumes build --finished=failure    specs

      # Retrieve the status of a specific build associated with latest commit
      fumes build --status specs

      # Retrieve the status of all builds associated with latest commit
      fumes build --status --all

BUG FIXES/UPDATES:
* Moved away from hard-coded exit codes in features
* Slight refactoring of build state validation
* Added rvmrc/cucumber:wip task [thanks Roy Kolak]
